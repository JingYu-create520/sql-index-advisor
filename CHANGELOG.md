## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-20

First release. Core premise: index advice you can verify — every finding carries
a rule ID, the evidence SQL, and a DDL a human can read before running it.

### Added

- **Parsers** (hand-written, no SQL-parser dependency):
  - `slowlog` — MySQL 5.7/8.0 slow query log reader that aggregates events by SQL
    fingerprint, so a pattern repeated 400 times ranks as one item by total cost
    instead of flooding the report.
  - `sql` — statement analyser for the documented subset: tables and aliases,
    ANSI/comma joins with `ON` predicates, `WHERE` equality / `IN` / ranges /
    `BETWEEN` / prefix `LIKE` / `IS NULL`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` with direction,
    `LIMIT` (literal vs placeholder), projections and `SELECT` aliases.
  - `mapper` — MyBatis XML reader keeping `<select id>` **line numbers**, with
    `#{}`/`${}` normalisation, `<include>` inlining, `<foreach>` collapsing,
    `<where>/<set>/<trim>` handling, `&lt;` entities, CDATA, and recursive
    `<choose>` expansion into statement variants.
  - `fingerprint` — comment stripping, literal masking, `IN (…)` list folding.
- **Rules SIA001–SIA007**: missing index candidate, prefix index, leftmost-prefix
  violation, function/expression on an indexed column, implicit type conversion,
  deep pagination, covering index opportunity. Composite index order is
  equality → group/order → range, because a range predicate stops later columns
  from serving equality lookups or sorting.
- **Rule engine** with input-dependency gating: rules declare `needsSchema` and
  `needsMetrics`, and every skipped rule is reported with the reason — silence is
  never rendered as "all clear". A throwing rule is contained and surfaced.
- **Reports**: coloured terminal table (`--lang auto|zh|en`), stable JSON, GitHub
  workflow annotations with `file`/`line`/`title`, and `--emit-sql` migration
  output that deduplicates identical DDL and never emits `DROP`.
- **LLM layer** (`--llm`): default offline `mock` provider plus any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `SIA_LLM_BASE_URL` / `SIA_LLM_API_KEY` /
  `SIA_LLM_MODEL`. Endpoint failures fall back to offline text. Tests lock that
  enabling it cannot change the finding set.
- **Four delivery forms**: CLI (`sia`), MCP stdio server (`sia mcp`, `sia-mcp`)
  exposing `analyze_sql` / `analyze_slow_log` / `analyze_mapper` /
  `explain_rules`, an Agent Skill, and a composite GitHub Action.
- **Exit codes**: `0` clean, `1` findings at or above `--fail-on` (default
  `error`), `2` runtime error — so first-time adoption does not turn a green
  build red.
- `examples/schema-dump.sql` — pure `information_schema` query to produce
  `schema.json` without the tool ever connecting to a database.
- Test suite: 185 tests covering parser snapshots, one positive and one negative
  case per rule, degradation on malformed input, report formats, and a real
  stdio JSON-RPC handshake against the built MCP bundle.
- Docs: bilingual README and `docs/rules.md` recording each rule's trigger,
  reasoning and known false-positive boundary.

### Known limitations

- No live `EXPLAIN` (planned as `--explain` in v2); MySQL only.
- Deep pagination needs a **literal** `LIMIT` offset, so `LIMIT #{offset}, #{size}`
  in a Mapper is not judged.
- Implicit conversion needs a literal; a `Long` bound to a `VARCHAR` column via
  `#{}` is invisible statically.
- Statements outside the documented SQL subset are skipped with an `info` note
  rather than guessed at.
